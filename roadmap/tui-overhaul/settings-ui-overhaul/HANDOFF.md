## What Happened

We spent this session auditing why `/models` and other slash commands are broken in the LiteAI TUI after removing the `HomeRoute` and refactoring settings. We studied Claude Code (`D:\claude-code`) and Gemini CLI (`D:\gemini-cli`) architectures in depth.

### Key Finding
The current LiteAI TUI has a **fundamentally flawed architecture** for dialogs/settings. Patching individual bugs (we fixed 3) won't help — the problems are structural:

1. **BlankSession (homepage) has no modal rendering slot** — modals store state but never render
2. **Multiple competing `useInput` hooks** — DialogSelect has both a TextInput AND keybindings processing the same keys
3. **Provider names flicker/disappear on scroll** — rendering bugs in the list component
4. **`/` slash suggestion arrows don't work** — input handling conflicts
5. **Copy is broken** — includes extra whitespace
6. **The whole thing looks bad** — not just bugs, the visual design is poor

### Decision Made
**Full rewrite of the settings UI and homepage**, using Claude Code / Gemini CLI rendering patterns as reference. NOT patching the current broken system.

## What Was Already Done (Revert or Keep)

Three patches were applied in this session. They are correct but may be irrelevant if doing a full rewrite:

| File | Change | Keep/Revert? |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `app.tsx` | Split `BlankSession` into wrapper + `BlankSessionContent`, added modal rendering slot | **Revert** — homepage is being rewritten |
| `dialog-select.tsx` | Added `inputFilter` to block navigation keys from TextInput | **Keep** — this is a real bug fix regardless |
| `default-bindings.ts` | Removed `j`/`k` from Select context, added `pageup`/`pagedown`/`home`/`end` | **Keep** — correct improvement |

## Architecture Reference (Already Audited)

Full architecture analysis is in `d:\liteai\roadmap\settings-ui-overhaul\01-architecture-audit.md`.

### How Claude Code Does It
- **Source**: `D:\claude-code\src\commands\model\model.tsx`
- **Pattern**: Commands return JSX via `call(onDone, context)`. The REPL component owns a single `commandJsx` state slot. When set, it renders the JSX and disables the prompt. `onDone` clears it.
- **Model picker**: `<ModelPicker>` component with `useAppState` for model list, inline rendering in the REPL slot.
- **No separate routing or modal system** — just conditional rendering.

### How Gemini CLI Does It
- **Source**: `D:\gemini-cli\packages\cli\src\ui\`
- **Pattern**: `AppContainer.tsx` (2905 lines) owns all dialog state via hooks:
  ```
  useModelCommand() → { isModelDialogOpen, openModelDialog, closeModelDialog }
  useSettingsCommand() → { isSettingsDialogOpen, ... }
  useThemeCommand() → { isThemeDialogOpen, ... }
  ```
- **Slash command processor**: `useSlashCommandProcessor` hook returns action descriptors (`{ type: 'dialog', dialog: 'model' }`), which `AppContainer` maps to `openModelDialog()`.
- **Rendering**: `App.tsx` receives boolean flags as props, conditionally renders dialog components.
- **Focus**: Implicit — dialog components take focus when rendered, main input loses it.

### Key Files to Study in Next Session
```
D:\claude-code\src\commands\model\model.tsx          — Model picker JSX (297 lines)
D:\claude-code\src\commands.ts                        — Command registry pattern

D:\gemini-cli\packages\cli\src\ui\AppContainer.tsx    — Main orchestrator (2905 lines, lines 940-1060 for model/settings)
D:\gemini-cli\packages\cli\src\ui\hooks\useModelCommand.ts     — Dialog state hook (32 lines)
D:\gemini-cli\packages\cli\src\ui\hooks\slashCommandProcessor.ts — Command dispatch (764 lines)
D:\gemini-cli\packages\cli\src\ui\commands\modelCommand.ts     — Model command (2042 lines — shows how model picker renders)
```

## What to Build (Scope)

### 1. Remove Current Homepage (`BlankSession`)
The current `BlankSession` in `app.tsx:45-128` shows Logo + PromptInput + Tips. Replace with a cleaner boot-to-prompt design like Gemini CLI (no splash screen, just the prompt with a version line).

### 2. Rewrite Settings/Dialog System
Replace the broken `ModalPaneProvider` + `DialogSelect` + `tuiInterceptors` system with one of:

**Recommended: Gemini CLI "hook-per-dialog" pattern**
- Each dialog gets a `useXxxCommand()` hook returning `{ isOpen, open, close }`
- All hooks live in the main app component (or a dedicated `useDialogManager`)
- Slash commands return action descriptors, main component maps to dialog openers
- Dialogs are conditionally rendered — no context, no providers, no stack

**Why not Claude Code's pattern**: Claude Code's `local-jsx` return-JSX-from-command approach requires the REPL to own the rendering slot. That's essentially what our `ModalPaneProvider` tried to do (and failed). Gemini's approach is simpler — just boolean flags.

### 3. Fix the Slash Command Suggestion UI
When typing `/`, the up/down arrow suggestion picker needs to work. Currently broken because of input handling conflicts. Study how Gemini CLI handles this in their `InputPrompt` component.

### 4. Visual Polish
The current rendering is visually poor. Study Gemini CLI's component library:
- `D:\gemini-cli\packages\cli\src\ui\components\` — all their UI components
- `D:\gemini-cli\packages\cli\src\ui\themes\` — their theme system
- `D:\gemini-cli\packages\cli\src\ui\layouts\` — layout components

## Prompt for Next Session

Copy-paste this to start the next session:

---

**I want to rewrite the LiteAI TUI settings and homepage UI. This is a follow-up from a previous session that audited the architecture.**

**Read these documents first:**
- `d:\liteai\roadmap\settings-ui-overhaul\HANDOFF.md` — full context from last session
- `d:\liteai\roadmap\settings-ui-overhaul\01-architecture-audit.md` — Claude Code vs Gemini CLI vs LiteAI comparison

**Reference codebases:**
- `D:\claude-code` — Claude Code's TUI (model picker in `src/commands/model/model.tsx`)
- `D:\gemini-cli` — Gemini CLI's TUI (settings in `packages/cli/src/ui/`)

**Goals:**
1. Remove the current `BlankSession` homepage — boot directly to a clean prompt (like Gemini CLI)
2. Rewrite the settings/dialog system using Gemini CLI's "hook-per-dialog" pattern (boolean flags, no ModalPaneProvider/context)
3. Fix slash command `/` suggestion picker (up/down arrows must work)
4. Make it look good — study how Claude Code and Gemini CLI render their model pickers and settings dialogs
5. Delete `modal-pane.tsx` and `use-navigation.ts` — replace with explicit dialog state management

**Start with a plan. Don't code until I approve.**
