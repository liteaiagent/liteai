# Specification Quality Checklist: Engine Loop Decoupling

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-05-04  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
- The spec deliberately bounds scope to Phases 1-3 only (Checkpointer Interface, Self-Contained Loop, Event Fan-Out). Subagent result flow (Phase 4) and backward execution (Phase 5) are explicitly out of scope and documented in Assumptions.
- The `processSubtask()` migration (14 direct DB writes → checkpointer ops) is flagged in Assumptions as the largest single task — this will need careful attention during planning.
